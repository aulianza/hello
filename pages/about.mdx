# About

My name is Ryan Aulia (*he/him*), I'm 25 years old and I was born and raised in Banda Aceh. I currently live in Jakarta and work remotely as a frontend software engineer at [Paper.id](https://paper.id).

Besides that, I also manage several projects with my friends under our startup company, [PT. FlexCode Space Limited](https://flexcode.space).

While I've been interested in technology since the kindergarten, my programming journey started in 2013 when I started learning HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.

Nowadays, my main programming languages are TypeScript and JavaScript, but I also use PHP for my backend side projects.

When it comes to offline activities, I hugely enjoy riding a bike. Besides that, I love travelling! As of today, I've been to several countries and I'm looking forward to going to more places in the future.
